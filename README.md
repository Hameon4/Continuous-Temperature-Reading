# Continuous-Temperature-Reading
This was an assignment from my course of Embedded Systems

QUESTION:
Three analog temperature Sensors are connected to channels 0, 1, and 2 of ATMEG328P.  Write an AVR C program that continuously reads the temperature values from the three sensors connected to channels 0, 1 and 2 (ADC0, ADC1, ADC2). The program will turn on an LED connected to PORTD pin 3 if the values of the three sensors are not equal. Use the following ADC configuration. 

•	Single-ended mode operation.
•	Select manual trigger mode.
•	Disable ADC interrupt. 
•	Select AVCC as the reference voltage. 
•	ADC result is right justified. 
•	Select the ADC Prescaler 32.
